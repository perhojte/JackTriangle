This is a simple program made in the Jack language as defined in Chapter 9 of the book "The Elements of Computing Systems"

The program takes the length of the three sides of a triangle as input.
It then determines if the triangle is scalene, equilateral, isosceles or invalid given the input.
Finally the type of triangle is reported to the user.
If the input was invalid, an error message is shown, and the programm aborts.
